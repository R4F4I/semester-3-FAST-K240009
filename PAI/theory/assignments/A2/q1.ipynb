    "\n",
    "Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure your assignment is graded. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Deadline and Late Policy\n",
    "* **Late submissions are not permitted**.\n",
    "* Any assignment submitted after the deadline will automatically receive **zero marks**.\n",
    "* Technical difficulties are **not a valid excuse** for late submission; plan to submit well before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Academic Integrity: Plagiarism\n",
    "* Your submission must be **entirely your own work**.\n",
    "* **Plagiarism is strictly prohibited**. This includes copying code from classmates or AI (though you can take guidance from AI).\n",
    "* All submissions will be checked for plagiarism.\n",
    "* Any instance of plagiarism will result in an **automatic zero marks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Required Files\n",
    "You must submit a total of **5 files**:\n",
    "1.  **One PDF Document**: A single, well-formatted PDF containing solutions for all questions, renamed with your roll number (e.g., 24K-####).\n",
    "2.  **Four Code Files (.ipynb)**: A separate, runnable code file for each question.\n",
    "    * Name your files clearly (e.g., `Q1.ipynb`, `Q2.ipynb`, `Q3.ipynb`, `Q4.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. PDF Formatting Instructions\n",
    "Your single PDF document is your main report and must be organized and clearly presented. For each question, you must include the following items in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Solution Code (text format)**: Copy and paste your final, working code directly into the PDF. Do not use screenshots of your code. The code must be formatted properly so it is readable.\n",
    "* **Output Screenshot**: Immediately following the code, insert a clear screenshot that shows your program running and producing the required output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Checklist\n",
    "Before you submit, check that you have:\n",
    "* [ ] 1 formatted PDF file.\n",
    "* [ ] 4 separate code files (one for each question).\n",
    "* [ ] Checked that the PDF contains both the formatted code text and the output screenshot for every question.\n",
    "* [ ] Confirmed your work is original and free of plagiarism.\n",
    "* [ ] Submitted all 5 files **before the deadline**.\n",
    "* [ ] **Submit the same on your GitHub also**.\n",

    "## üèè Question 01: Robust Cricket API Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Build a robust, command-line tool to fetch and display a summary of live cricket matches from the `cricketdata.org` API.\n",
    "**Topics:** File I/O, Error Handling (`try...except`), API Consumption (`requests`, `json`), Data Parsing, Dictionary/List operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Configurable Endpoint:** The script must **read the API URL from a local text file named `api.txt`**; it cannot hardcode the URL.\n",
    "2.  **Robust Error Handling:** Use `try...except` blocks to handle:\n",
    "    * **Network Errors:** Gracefully handle `requests.exceptions.RequestException` (e.g., no internet) and print a user-friendly error.\n",
    "    * **HTTP Errors:** If the API returns a non-200 status code (e.g., 401, 404), the script must print the error `status_code` and the raw `response.text` for debugging.\n",
    "3.  **API Status First:** The script must first parse the JSON and print a summary of the API's own status metadata.\n",
    "    * Print **all top-level keys** except for the `'data'` key (too large) and the `'apikey'` key (for security).\n",
    "4.  **Graceful API Failures:**\n",
    "    * Check that the JSON's `\"status\"` key is `\"success\"` and that a `\"data\"` key exists and is not empty.\n",
    "    * If the status is not `\"success\"`, print the error message provided in the API's **`\"reason\"`** key.\n",
    "5.  **Formatted Match Display:** If all checks pass, loop through the list of matches in the `\"data\"` key and print a clearly formatted summary showing the:\n",
    "    * Match Name (`name`)\n",
    "    * Match Status (`status`)\n",
    "    * Venue (`venue`)\n",
    "    * Date (`date`)\n",
    "6.  **Nested Score Details:** Inside the match loop, check if a `'score'` key exists and contains data. If it does, loop through the nested list of scores and print the details for each inning:\n",
    "    * Inning (`inning`)\n",
    "    * Runs (`r`)\n",
    "    * Wickets (`w`)\n",
    "    * Overs (`o`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final output should be a clean, readable report printed directly to the console.\n"
