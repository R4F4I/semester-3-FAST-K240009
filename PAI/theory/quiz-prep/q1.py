### ðŸ§  Problem 1: The Smart-Trading Bot Simulator

**Concept:** Design a simulation of a stock market where a trading bot makes decisions based on market fluctuations. This problem will test your understanding of object-oriented design, data manipulation, and implementing logic-based interactions between objects.

**Description:**

You are tasked with building a `Smart-Trading Bot Simulator`. This involves creating a system with three main components: a `Trader`, a `Stock`, and a `Market`.

**Core Classes:**

1.  **`Stock` Class:**
    
    -   **Attributes:** `name` (string), `ticker` (string), `initial_price` (float), `current_price` (float), `volatility` (float, a measure of how much the price can change, e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
    -   **Method:** `update_price()`: This method should simulate a price change. The new price should be calculated based on the `current_price` and `volatility`. The change can be a random increase or decrease within the `volatility` range.
        
2.  **`Trader` Class:**
    
    -   **Attributes:** `name` (string), `initial_capital` (float), `current_capital` (float), `portfolio` (a dictionary where keys are stock tickers and values are the number of shares owned).
    -   **Methods:**
        
        -   `buy(stock, quantity)`: Allows the `trader` to buy a certain `quantity` of a `stock`. This should decrease the `trader`'s `current_capital` and update the `portfolio`. A `trader` cannot buy if they don't have enough `capital`.
        -   `sell(stock, quantity)`: Allows the `trader` to sell a certain `quantity` of a `stock`. This should increase the `current_capital` and update the `portfolio`. A `trader` cannot sell shares they don't own.
        -   `evaluate_portfolio(market)`: Calculates the current total value of the `trader`'s `portfolio` based on the `current_prices` of the `stocks` in the given `market`.
            
3.  **`Market` Class:**
    
    -   **Attributes:** `name` (string), `stocks` (a dictionary of `Stock` objects, with `tickers` as keys).
    -   **Methods:**
		-   `add_stock(stock)`: Adds a new `stock` to the `market`.
		-   `simulate_day()`: This is the core of the simulation. For each `stock` in the `market`, it should call the `update_price()` method. It should then print a summary of the `market`'s activity for the day.
		-   `get_stock(ticker)`: Retrieves a `stock` by its `ticker`.


**Challenge:**

Create a simulation that runs for 30 "days."

1.  Initialize a `Market` with at least 5 different `stocks`, each with a unique `volatility`.
2.  Initialize a `Trader` with a starting `capital`.
3.  For each day of the simulation:
    -   The `Market` updates the `prices` of all `stocks`.
    -   The `Trader` bot must decide whether to buy or sell `stocks` based on a simple algorithm of your choice. For example, it could buy a `stock` if its `price` drops by more than 5% in a day, or sell if it rises by more than 7%.
    -   Print out the `trader`'s actions for the day and the end-of-day value of their `portfolio`.
4.  At the end of the 30 days, report the `trader`'s final `capital` and total `portfolio` value.
