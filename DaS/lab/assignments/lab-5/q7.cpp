/*

Task # 7 : Imagine you are given a grid representing a maze, where '0's represent obstacles(red
highlighted) or walls, and '1's represent open paths or empty cells. You have two arrays at your
disposal: an empty Solution array and a maze represented by the following grid:

0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 0


Your task is to guide a lion through this maze from the starting point at (0, 0) to reach a piece of meat
located at the destination point (4, 4). The lion is also not allowed to move diagonally. The lion can
only move through open paths ('1's) while avoiding obstacles ('0's).
Please provide a C++ code that uses a backtracking algorithm to navigate the maze and move the lion
to the meat. Additionally, display the contents of the Solution array after the lion has reached the
meat.
