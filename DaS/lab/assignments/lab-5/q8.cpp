Task # 8: Imagine a 4x4 grid where a person is on a mission to collect as many flags as possible.
Each cell of the grid represents a potential location for placing a flag. However, there are constraints:
Only one flag can be placed in each row or column.
Additionally, no two flags can ever be placed on the same diagonal (i.e., no two flags can threaten
each other diagonally).
Your goal is to design a backtracking algorithm in C++ to help this person maximize the number of
flags collected while adhering to these constraints. After implementing the algorithm, provide the
code and report the maximum number of flags that can be placed on the 4x4 grid.
