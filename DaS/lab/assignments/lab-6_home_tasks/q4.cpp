/*

Task 4: Consider you have an expression x=12+13-5(0.5+0.5) +1 which results to 20. Implement a
stack-based implementation to solve this question via linked lists (linked lists can be single or double)
and the resulted output must be at the top of the stack. Note that the x and the equal sign must be
present in the stack and when inserting the top value (20 result) all the values must be present in the
stack (You can pop and push them accordingly)
