specified by the user. Matrix Resizing: Implement a method to resize the matrix. The new size
should be provided as input (new rows and columns). If the new size is larger, initialize the new
elements with a given value. If the new size is smaller, truncate the matrix. Matrix Transposition:
Implement a method to transpose the matrix (rows become columns and vice versa). Matrix
