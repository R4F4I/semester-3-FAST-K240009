A university is managing the marks of students in multiple subjects. Each department has a
different number of students. Each student has marks for a fixed number of 5 subjects.
You need to store this data in a appropriate dynamic array where rows = number of departments
and columns = number of students in each department. Then, calculate the highest, lowest and
average marks of each department and display them.
