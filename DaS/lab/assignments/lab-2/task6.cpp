/*

You're developing a program to manage a seating chart for a conference held in a hall with
multiple rows of seats. Each row has a different seat capacity. To efficiently handle the seating
arrangements, you decide to use a dynamic array. Implement a C++ code that allocates memory
for the seating chart and allows attendees' names to be inputted for each seat. Choose and
implement the appropriate type of dynamic array for this scenario.
